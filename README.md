# H1 Chief in Tech : Notes & Reflections
Welcome to a personal collection of notes based on "Chief in Tech" by Anna Radulovski. This isn't a summary or a review. Its my notes that I have taken from the book. 

# H2 What's Inside

Observations about gender bias in the tech world.

Thoughts on where inequality really begins (hint: it's earlier than most we think).

How toys, childhood expectations, and workplace norms silently shape leadership gaps.

Personal takeaways on microaggressions, imposter syndrome, and self-worth.

Tools for surviving — and thriving — in systems that weren't designed with everyone in mind.

# H2 Why I made this 
Because reading isn't enough. Some stories stick with you and push you to reflect, speak up, or just feel seen. These notes are one way to keep that conversation going — with me or with others who’ve walked similar paths.

A Few Realities We Talk About
You don't need permission to belong. Not in a meeting, not in leadership, not in tech.

Confidence and ambition aren’t gendered. But how we’re judged still is.

Imposter syndrome is common — especially for high achievers. But it can be unlearned.

There’s strength in saying: I deserve to be here.

Resilience isn't soft. It’s a hard-earned skill — the kind you develop after being passed over, questioned, or underestimated.

# H2 To Anyone Reading
These notes aren’t polished. They’re raw in places. But they’re real — and that’s what matters. If you’ve ever been the only one in the room, doubted your voice, or waited to be perfect before stepping up — this space is for you.

You’re not alone. You don’t need to shrink. And you absolutely belong
